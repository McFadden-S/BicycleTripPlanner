###### Deployment
Preferred Setting: Pixel 4, Android 12.0
Android was decided because the current location for IOS emulator is hard coded in America however the application works fine on iPhone devices

Deployment URL: https://appetize.io/app/ad1kjwa1j59xrn21cwfhdea478?device=pixel6&osVersion=12.0&scale=75

Note: Appetize Approximates user's location and may potentially be a location
with no nearby stations, however If running Appetize from Bush House it will
Approximate in a central London location with nearby stations
