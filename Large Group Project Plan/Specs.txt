Risk Assessment
  - Covid: Probability Medium/High, Impact Low
    - If Test Positive: Hybrid approach, people in person on call with those at home
    - Masks and Hand Sanitizer
  - Github Crash: Probability Very Low, Impact Low/Medium
  - Flutter: Being newer could have issue Probability Low, Impact Medium
  - API(s): we rely on becoming unusable
      Likelihood: Unlikely
      Impact: High
      Response: Try to find a new API as similar as possible to the one we were using, otherwise, meet with client to replan the project
  - Personal Information Security Risk (Epic 3): Personal frequent routes get leaked
      Likelihood: Medium unmitigated, low if we implement security (research firebase security)
      Impact: High
