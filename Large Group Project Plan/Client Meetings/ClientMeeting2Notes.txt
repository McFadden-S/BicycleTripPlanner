Loading all bike points: no need
  load/show as you view an area
  filter by distance

As a user i would like to select destination by pressing area on map

As a user i would like to minimize route card if you press outside of it

If start destination is not current location give two options either:
show walking directions to the start locations or
or change start location to current location and make start an intermediate

Oriente camera to where user is looking

When expanding/minimizing cards animate it
